# License Plate Recognition System

This project implements an automated License Plate Recognition (LPR) system using deep learning. It processes images or video frames to detect vehicles and recognize their license plates in real-time.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Vehicle and license plate detection using deep learning (YOLO).
- Easy to customize or fine-tune with your own dataset.


## ðŸ“Š Results

The system draws bounding boxes around detected license plates and displays the recognized text, saving annotated images and logs.
